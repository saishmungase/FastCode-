## 🚀 About CodeRush
CodeRush is a gamified competitive programming platform designed to make coding challenges more engaging, rewarding, and performance-driven.

Once users sign up, they gain access to a curated list of coding problems. Each problem can be attempted only once, adding a strategic layer to the challenge. Users submit their solutions through a built-in code editor. If the solution passes all test cases, points are awarded based on the efficiency and optimization of the code — ranging from 1 to 10.

The platform features a real-time leaderboard that highlights the top scorers. The top three users earn Gold, Silver, and Bronze badges, encouraging healthy competition and continuous improvement.

Whether you're looking to sharpen your problem-solving skills or prove your coding speed and efficiency, CodeRush is the place to test your limits.
